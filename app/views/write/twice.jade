    Nothing will be taken away  
    
    or prevent you from walking   
    down the three steps out  
    your door into your maroon  
    Impreza and taking your regular  
    ice-water bath around the block,  
    or is it purple? Or is it beautiful,  
    that I can’t tell? My eyes which  
    have been formed and deformed by  
    the unseen glassblower, disguised  
    as the men in my memories, stamped  
    and fingerprinted by the women  
    and if I’m lucky I get to   
    keep my own hands intact  
    and all.  
      
    or keep you from feeling, no,   
    experiencing the type of misery on  
    gray days in April that build  
    character and force you outdoors,  
    front and center for the visitors  
    and babies and bench strangers  
    to witness, and ask me, is  
    my pain, front and center,  
    like this, what I worship?  
      
    or stop you from writing about  
    trees and the solidarity they don’t  
    have, even while you sit among   
    them, their bare fingers stuck  
    out of the ground, maybe  
    offensive, like the truck meant   
    to throw toilet water at you,   
    and like I realized it’s   
    okay to not be original  
    and yell at yourself for it.  
      
    or force you to decide between  
    the pigeon or the dove, or   
    rice or noodles, or Spring or  
    Autumn, or Monday or Thursday.  
    The carbon strength it takes for   
    you to pray through the caffeine  
    scouring your veins, or is it just  
    brick strength? In a brick city?  
    With brick friends, recently promoted,  
    recently helping me paddle  
    upstream, against the  
    missed calls and our seven  
    day week and three hundred and  
    sixty-five and a quarter day  
    year. Don’t sink! We scream and   
    we try this many times, and we are  
    bound as one, stuck together as   
    any well-implemented construction  
    plan. Pray through it, for  
      
    nothing will be taken away.

  pre.poem.
    I am the idiot child licking its own vomit,  
    rolling around and wailing;  
    
    and then the coffee  
    to clean out my bowels  
     
    arrives on time: one thing  
    I’ve been given.  
      
    I am the little shit who takes more  
    than can fit into my tortured stomach;  
     
    and then the milk stays spilled but is still  
    chocolate, thick enough to  
      
    almost make up for its fatal  
    stench.

    i wait for  
    you to  
    leave  
    and the rice  
    to boil,  

    because i  
    am at the bottom of  
    the pot  
    and i can’t give  
    you a counter  
    argument.  
    
    
  .poem-title.poem Object Hunting
  pre.poem.
    Moving out of the way I lose my voice,   
    I eat the candy string too quickly — it  
    runs out before I ever get to  
    it, objects disappear like ribbons of egg  
    yoke into soup — it must be   
    the boiling broth and the   
    deep pot. Well then it’s everyone  
    isn’t it? What use do I have  
    for becoming twenty different people  
    when I’ve covered my mirrors  
    and boiled my mind’s efforts?    

    Whispers of clouds on a humid  
    Philly day, the first attempt of  
    sandpaper dirt to produce   
    grass again. Yesterday they brought  
    in fresh manure and it’s the  
    closest thing to the sign of Jonah.    

    I thought that if it was a   
    warning sign I wouldn’t understand it  
    in the boiling heat anyway, it  
    is the semblance of a face just too  
    far away to identify, wet footprints   
    long crusted, dried, interpreted, and  
    abandoned already by someone before me.

    squinting down it is already  
    a challenge  
    and there is a mosquito  
    carrying no malaria  
    because my friends are  
    singular and like satin.

    It is either  
    dirt rubbed skin  
    filing against concrete  
    or  
    my rubbery body  
    finally getting into  
    bed.

    green lamppost  
    gray tree  
    for once a safety net

    me
    
  .poem-title.poem Of Place
  pre.poem.
    The house didn't know what it was asking for when it became a
    sanctuary. Annie, thumping across the third floor, and the cat, 
    menacing. Then, I didn't know where I was going, I just knew 
    about how good it was, the springtime breeze: like stepping into 
    an oven walking down Baltimore, the sparkling concrete at peace 
    with the deep soil of the Woodlands -- full of dead people, 
    probably rich. I think about each tombstone I was familiar with, 
    the life those people let go communed in the center of the field 
    for me to play with, colors and feelings all lined up at my 
    disposal. I can't go there, you said, all I think about is 
    death. Now, all I think about is death too. And the room that 
    welcomed me with its orange wood is now singed with your smoke, 
    and reeks of death. It's all I can think about. Spending the 
    year afterward unlearning, and taking each tool out of the box 
    one by one and throwing it into the Schuykill until it shattered 
    against the stone, not even hitting the water -- it's all I can 
    think about. I didn't know what I was asking for when I entered 
    the house, or called you a sanctuary. Now I stay north, away 
    from the deep green trees guarding the dead who died without 
    ever mustering an answer to a question they weren't forced to 
    ask. The sky is the same, clumped up and prodding, light purple 
    and pink. Always beautiful. I climbed out of the oven right into 
    the storm -- always raining, never clean. The time it took for 
    me to befriend the fleshy ants was long enough for them to march 
    right back into the ground. To live under a black cloud masked 
    as climate change, and stumble around blindly never looking each 
    other in the eye, never again synchronizing, its all I can think 
    about now. Up ahead a plane starts, painstakingly journeying 
    through the sky. It won't come back. I used to think it was just 
    light pollution but I'll never think that again. You just passed 
    through and I avoid walking down Baltimore.

    don’t be like     

    the drop  
    asking for permission  
    to drip down  
    the sleeve,  
    spreading its limbs,  
    basking in the attention,  
    the excitement  
    of getting caught,  

    or  

    the straw  
    shattered,  
    guilty of its deed,  
    drowning to stay afloat,  
    picking up broken bits,  
    thinning out the host  
    as it drifts  
    further and wider  
    apart.

    i found you in the  
    ridged skin of the  
    resting trees,  
    passersby,  

    in the fertile confidence   
    of the swarming landscape,  
    placeholder for my worries,  

    in the immediate bend,  
    divine twists,  
    stroking the spark in my mind  
    awake.  

    i found you at the   
    forefront  
    of my skull,  
    waiting patiently,  
    the ribbed bench underneath me,      
    earthy green.  

    to know you is  
    a balloon that will never pop,  
    a broth that will never end,  
    a sun that will never set.  

    i found you in the  
    ridged skin of the   
    resting trees,  
    passersby.

    what is it about the glow  
    on the corner   
    of the dresser it  
    reminds me of  
    your eyes  
    the entire room  
    pulled inside  
    quickly  
    i think of you  
    everyday and  
    package you up neatly   
    but i know   
    you won’t get in  
    you  
    just want to graduate
