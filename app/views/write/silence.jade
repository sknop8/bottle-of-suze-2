  h1.poetry-heading [wip] As Nothing as Silent

  .poem-title.poem A little low on oxygen
  pre.poem.
    Here it is again: the richness of life:
    early spring, the possibility of God,
    memories of pain turned sweet,
    dark scatterings snapping into place:
    it is a story, it is full-bodied love and loss,
    it is walking upright as daylight begins to end: 
    a great distance from despair, the relief 
    caught in my throat, my light-headed 
    wanderings: overflown with piercing aliveness.

  .poem-title.poem Laceration
  pre.poem.
    How about this? laceration. Wait for the end,
    seek the trace of the groove and follow it 
    down tracheally and fall, (nice dream),
    it is a battery, an endless recycling of misery.
    Tie one ribbon-end loosely to the neck, hope to see 
    the green edge again; my head toppled,
    the waiting over.
    Is there intracranial safety? Fold the skin neatly 
    into a square, it is not the time for crying.

  .poem-title.poem 2/22/22
  pre.poem.
    For your cowering and your breath, unhurried
    stases and sorrows, working into the evening,
    you come to me like a question, like play,
    a pattern to untangle, a landslip.

    I don't know how to describe spring to you,
    I worry through the night.

  .poem-title.poem Salves, vanities
  pre.poem.
    I like you covering my heart;
    you hold it and show it how to pulse, keep it alive.
    I like my motion guided, I like water pouring 
    out of my mouth.
    I tie the strings around my arms and legs, you
    control me. I want you to fix me with your
    careful, small hands.
    I am glowing from your gaze inside me, the
    substance of my being. I like the spotlight.
    I like you scaffolding my body;
    you hold it upright, beautiful and strong.

  .poem-title.poem A cyclist stopping for a smoke
  pre.poem.
    You were sitting there looking so sad,
    a cyclist stopping for a smoke.
    (Is now the time for creation?
    You'll go back to the dark room muddied
    all over.)
    I saw you years ago: that overcast
    face, your body like an S. I couldn't explain it,
    but I knew your implosions.
    You're like a dying roach--your arms so tense,
    your voice too soft.
    (Can we push on?)
    You decline; you're panicking. The shadow
    seizes into definition: now we see the ghost
    clearly. Now we're in the room with no windows.
    Here appear your hollow cheeks, your legs 
    bound and hanging like rotisserie.
    I try to pull us toward relief, but you just sit 
    there, looking so sad.

  .poem-title.poem 6/9/21
  pre.poem.
    A silence has ensued,
    for her I'd endure the waiting.
    Though we pass the time with our heads down,
    I know I'm wrong.
