    .verse And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will." <br>Matthew 26:39
    .thoughts Jesus asking God to "let this cup pass" has been really with me today. I am comforted that Jesus, who is perfect, still suffered and did not want to suffer, but also submitted to God because he knew of the amazing, amazing glory to come. I feel I am struggling today, and God, <i>if it be possible, let this cup pass from me</i>. NEVERTHELESS, not as  I will but as you will, God. Thank you Jesus for being the absolute role model of how to pray. I feel lately as if I am coming to know a small corner of how you felt when you felt rejected by humans for the sake of bringing glory to the Father. It hurts so much and I can't imagine what you endured. Your prayer of petition and submission rings through my heart.

    .verse For with you is the fountain of life;<br>in your light do we see light.<br>Psalm 36:9
    .thoughts I am starting this page to encourage myself, but I want to make it public so that I am also held accountable. I'm hungry for the word of God but I am also weak, forgetful, lazy, and easily confused. I yearn to drink from the fountain of life. I want to set my eyes still on Him all the days I am here on earth, and all the days forevermore, and I no longer want to romanticize or bask in darkness! I pray that I can post daily on this page about my convictions while reading the Word, and that having this quick, accessible place to store up these convictions will encourage my heart in God when I feel low or dry, and also nudge me to <strong>take courage</strong> and <strong>stay steadfast</strong>. My joy is deeply tied to knowing truth!
