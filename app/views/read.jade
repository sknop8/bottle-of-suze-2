      Ooh wow, this is really beautiful so far. I haven't read sci-fi in a while. I got this for like a dollar at the book sale outside of King Library and I'm glad I did!!

      So, my story with this one...
      <br><br>
      When I was in high school, I would go to Barnes & Nobles a lot. Usually I would spend around half an hour there. I used to flip through books, and browse, etc. One time I went and I was captivated by the cover of a version of <i>The Stranger</i> that was black and white and hypnotizing. I started to read that every time I went to Barnes & Nobles, but I would keep forgetting where I left off and ended up re-reading the beginning a lot. I never got very far, but I always wanted to finish the novel. Years later now, I've finally read the book! It only took two days, and while I'm glad I finally read it, it was a pretty bare, anxiety-filled book.
