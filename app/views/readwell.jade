  //-   //- .review  cannot express just how much these stories are my type of stories. odd, full of sadness approached inquisitively; characters with purposefully little self-consciousness; or too much self-consciousness. The little, quiet anxieties, oddities of life. strange inner lives. and that's just the beginning.

      .read-date 24 Jan - 15 Feb 2021
    .review Wonderful, brief, varied, moody gusts of Virginia Woolf. I think if you haven't read much Woolf before and you're looking to dip your toes in, this is an excellent place to start. Her deceptively slim novels are dense and require (at least from me) an intense amount of concentration, so I understand the hesitation to read them. The stories in this collection, though, are each less than 10 pages, and are the perfect afternoon dose of Woolf. There is something vital and essential to Woolf's writing for me; it seems I can't go too long without it before slipping into a kind of gray literary torpor.

      .publish-info 2017
      .read-date 11-23 Jan 2021
    .review electrifying and genuinely frightening. I liked how Machado played love and fear off one another, sometimes they worked together and sometimes they pulled in different directions or overlaid each other, like in the haunting (from a covid-19 perspective) recounting of a woman's partners against the backdrop of a deadly pandemic. I appreciated how sex as a narrative element was never quite antagonistic/scary, but instead another layer of enthrallment. the body was a weird meeting place for the supernatural, for lust, psychosis, dis/embodiment. these stories were riveting, surprising, thrilling, mysterious. they inspire in the reader a hunger for more ...

    .review [slam my heart into the ground] <br>--<br>This book really pokes the central wound of life right in the cornea. Yanagihara has given the world an enormous, epic, astounding empathic feat. I thought I would break or implode so many times throughout the reading process, yet somehow I've come out whole: mad at these 700 pages, for what they've done to me, the state they've left me in, (the memories they've given to me), but also in awe -- a much bigger awe: at Yanagihara's achievement; at our (the author's and the reader's) disappearance into this world; at the painful lifesource of friendship; at the beauty and fragility and uncertainty of being; and at the incomparable intimacy of sharing an entire life with people you love and who, mysteriously, love you.

    .review Ravel's the man but this biographer was not too illuminating. The best parts were direct quotes from Ravel, such as <br><br>"[O]ften it is not until years after, when the means of expression have finally surrendered all their secrets, that the real inner emotion of the music becomes apparent to the listener."<br><br>And (on the composition process), "I find a long period of conscious gestation, in general, necessary [...] I may thus be occupied for years without writing a single note of the work--after which the writing goes relatively rapidly; but there is still much time to be spent in eliminating everything that might be regarded as superfluous, in order to realize as completely as possible the longed-for final clarity."<br><br>In general, it's been fascinating to learn more about the lives and (first-hand) thoughts of the artists I admire (Woolf, St. Vincent Millay, Ravel, Weil, Nin), and I definitely would like to continue this thread.

Because each essay ("sketch") is relatively short, every argument/speculation packs a punch and invited me to think more formally about a wide range of essential topics: language, evolution, society, knowledge, consciousness, art, meaning. I found the sketches startling in their precision and rational creativity. I'm so glad I picked this up and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND NOW HAVE SO MANY NEW IDEAS IN MY HEAD!

      This book made me become pretty neurotic about getting enough sleep...ultimately a beneficial neurosis, I think. I would recommend everyone to read at least the first section. The studies described are all pretty astounding. Perhaps it’s too good a conclusion to be true, but it seems like sleep is that missing lurking variable behind most, if not all, areas of health science.
      <br><br>
      When I told my chronically sleep-deprived parents about the contents of this book they reacted as if I’d joined some doomsday cult. I say: if it’s possible for you right now, just try it for yourself: prioritizing 8 hours of good sleep is a small price to pay for well-being, creativity, intelligence, memory, and longevity.

    .review. 
      	Virginia Woolf puts me into such a state of overexcitement and frenzy, Mrs. Dalloway is an entire world and all of existence in one bursting day. I read some of the best sentences in the English language here!!
        <br><br>
        “Only for a moment; but it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for a moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over—the moment.”
        <br><br>
        Here is a novel to get lost inside of sentences, wandering the streets of London and the minds and pasts of its people. Woolf writes to fully convey a MOMENT—how large that moment can be, how full of meaning and sensation !! I wandered through this book, grasped at the beginnings and ends of thoughts, held on to feelings even as they disappeared, and felt the glowing, sensitive magnificence of the mystery of being.

      Incredibly Scottish, I had to look up every 7th word, but wonderful. Perfect accompaniment for an intimate excursion up whichever great mountain looms over you.

      “So, simply to look on anything, such as a mountain, with the love that penetrates to its essence, is to widen the domain of being in the vastness of non-being. Man has no other reason for his existence.”

      Yes, yes, yes! I dig it, these magnificent, magnificent visions of the road, this sprawling scroll of ever onwards and the ever illuminating vastness of wide open land.
      <br><br>
      This urgently told, go go go recounting of endless happenings on the road back and forth, up and down the U.S. has infected me with my own inner go, go, go—a thirst for experiencing life, finding what’s exciting about it, traveling across the country, and writing about it all with the splendid candor of Jack Kerouac’s prose, and talking about it in the decisive, enchanting, and insane manner of Neal Cassady.

      .read-date 20 Sep - 16 Oct 2019
    .review. 
      	I was so immediately immersed into this novel; Ferrante puts into words those dazzling emotions of friendship that I've also felt in my life--so mesmerizing, so captivating are those friendships, and here is one of the greatest friendships between women in all of the literature I've read.
        <br><br>
        Most of all, <i>My Brilliant Friend</i> is about the desperation, complexity, and attachment of intimate friendship. The strings that bind Lila and Lenù together are earth-shattering, bigger than any of the romantic love in the novel, inexplicable. The story of the beginning years of this epic friendship speaks to the power we hold over each other and the endless mysteries of relationships--as if they are a puzzle we long to resolve, to find security in, but that continue to confound, disappoint, and fascinate us.
        <br><br>
        I read this novel hungrily, all throughout thinking: this is the love of friends--lifelong, strange, full of tension and power dynamics; they're made of a fabric of unconditional protection, long-held hurt, comparison and inadequacy, moments of sheer joy, excitement, ecstasy, painful hyperawareness of the other, the secret pleasures of exclusivity, of going into the world together, alone except for each other. I found solace in Lenu's inner world, in her insecurities, her fragile heart, her confusion, and her submission to the inescapable, unfailing grasp that Lila seemed to have on her life.
        <br><br>
        I love what John Freeman wrote of the Neapolitan series: "Imagine if Jane Austen got angry and you'll have some idea how explosive these works are."
        <br><br>
        I so loved this novel and I'll be sure to read the next three!

    .review Oh my, there is so, so much to say, and I can’t say it all now. This was magnificent, brilliant, philosophical, intricate, dense. “Dostoyevsky paints like Rembrandt” (Andre Gide). I’ll miss reading about dear Alyosha, Dmitri, and Ivan every night. Dostoevsky’s fiction is unrivaled...his characters are rendered with unbelievable depth, and the sheer breadth of characters is breathtaking. He understands the rich, the poor, the wretched, and the righteous. All is deeply philosophical, and the experience of reading this spun me into a loop several times thinking and rethinking religion, morality, honor, and despair.

    .review. 
      This was fascinating to wrestle with! I don’t agree with some of it, but I think there’s always a time in our lives when we need to hear some good Stoic advice. It’s shocking that Seneca lived 2000 years ago, yet so many of the traps we fall into as humans seeking purpose and joy are the same, and he addresses them thoroughly and methodically.
      <br><br>
      “Of all people only those are at leisure who make time for philosophy, only those are really alive. For they not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but they annex every age to theirs. All the years that have been passed before them are added to their own.”<br>
      From the first essay/letter, “On the Shortness of Life”
      <br><br>
      Seneca really emphasizes stewardship of our time, and at first I resisted understanding this because I value generosity—i.e., giving my time and energies freely to a wide range of people and activities. Though Stoicism doesn’t naturally align with this sort of idealistically overflowing heart, I still think there’s a lot of wisdom for me to gain in how I give my time and energy, as they can be given foolishly.

      .title Just Mercy
      .author Bryan Stevenson
      .publish-info 2014
      .read-date 8 Mar - 8 Oct 2019
    .review. 
      “The power of just mercy is that it belongs to the undeserving. It’s when mercy is least expected that it’s most potent—strong enough to break the cycle of victimization and victimhood, retribution and suffering.”
      <br><br>
      The last few chapters of this book have made me think a lot about the suffering I’ve caused others in the name of “justice,” how harsh and unrelenting I’ve been, how inhumane. Stevenson also wrote:
      <br>
      “Fear and anger are a threat to justice; they can infect a community, a state, or a nation and make us blind, irrational, and dangerous.”
      <br><br>
      I realized that when Stevenson talks about “just mercy” he is addressing both the victims and the victimizers (for many of us have been both). He appreciates victims of injustice who forgive those who enacted the injustice on them, and he calls on the public and the state to have mercy on those who commit crimes—to understand the context they come from. We, as both people who have been hurt and people who hurt others, can show compassion and mercy to those who hurt us instead of acting out of self-righteous, fear-induced anger. Not only would this mercy be good, but it would more importantly be just.
      <br><br>
      “The death penalty is not about whether people deserve to die for the crimes they commit. The real question of capital punishment in this country is, Do we deserve to kill?”
      <br><br>
      There is so, so much to learn from this book. I haven’t even picked out the most important parts of this book for the review (such as the history of capital punishment, the cruel treatment of children in the criminal justice system, and the system of mass incarceration in the US); these thoughts are just what linger on with me as I finish the book. I highly recommend picking this one up! Stevenson writes with such honest clarity; his recollection of these important cases is both focused and passionate. I really appreciate this book for teaching me and moving my heart and mind.
