  p.description Here is my full watch list! (Mostly for my own reference because I have a poor memory). I'll continue to put the ones I felt were worth mentioning on the year-specific pages.

      li Stage Door
        span.sub 1937, Gregory La Cava
        //- 5 feb
        //- :) a gem with ginger rogers, katharine hepburn, and so many other wonderful funny women (and the first pre-50s film I've watched that passes the bechdel test with flying colors!). I really loved Ginger Rogers' spunky, sarcastic, loyal character. The clever banter between Rogers' and Hepburn's characters had me laughing throughout.
      li Camille
        span.sub 1936, George Cukor
        //- Greta Garbo
        //- 4 feb
        //- ...enter  greta  garbo!! sgarbo is perhaps the most special

      li Bringing Up Baby
        span.sub 1939, Howard Hawks
        //- 2 feb
        //- you know these crazy cats kate and cary i think are becoming my favorite duo
        //- both are sillier and more feminine in this, which just adds to the humor and the ridiculous lovability of their eccentric characters. the comedy in this was amazing!!
        //- "this is probably the silliest thing that has ever happened to me" ... me too
        //- hilarious screwball! really funny and absurds
        //- "all that happened happened because I was trying to keep you near me and I just did anything that came into my heads  "

      li His Girl Friday
        span.sub 1940, Howard Hawks
        //- feb 1
      li Holiday
        span.sub 1938, George Cukor
        //- 31 Jan
        //- I liked this one :-)
      li Sylvia Scarlett
        span.sub 1935, George Cukor
        //- 29 jan
        //- omg this was a wild ride. katharine hepburn is a wonderful boy. interesting queer overtones, and now that i've watched a significant number of wwii-era and post-war films, I'm more attuned to the difference in pre-war films: looser, less structured, playful, more promiscuous. I wonder if this film was unsuccessful at the time because hepburn was too good at her part, truly androgynous
        //- wikipedia says it best:
        //- The film is mostly known for its queer elements, with Hepburn's character continuing to do drag even after it is not necessary anymore for the character,[10] which "confused and disconcerted in equal measures."[11] It is considered that the sexual ambiguities and gender misunderstandings of the films were too daring for the time period, which made the audiences fail to see the humor in cross-dressing and mistaken identity.[12] It also resulted in movie audiences walking away from the movie, especially since it was insinuated or shown that both male and female characters were attracted to Hepburn's character, in and out of drag. While in drag, Sylvia is kissed by a woman and Monkley comments that he'd made "a proper hot water bottle" when they are changing to go to sleep. At the same time, Fane shows more interest in Sylvia while in drag, and losing it after she revealed she is a woman.[13]
        //- Some have argued that "Gender as a separate concept from sexuality or physical sex wouldn’t come about for another twenty years, so audiences had no context for Sylvia’s odd apparel" through the movie.[14] Nevertheless, the film is considered one of the few of the Golden Age of Hollywood to represent queerness respectfully.[15] It is now seen as "a monument to the sapphic impression Hepburn left in Hollywood",[16] with the film implying "that Sylvia might stay as Sylvester forever", even as she enters a relationship with a man.[17] Some, on the other hand, have considered that "these deliciously cheeky invitations are met with sexual panic and a predictable retreat into befrocked femininity".[18]
        //- 
        //- In conclusion though this movie was fun, interesting, even edgy, and has been one of the most memorable (and probably one of the favoritte) films I've watched pre-1950s.

        //- 18 sep
        //- strangely engrossing and beautifully shot ...boxing in black & white
        //- i liked this film, it was simple, focused on 1 event, took its time, yet emotionally suspenseful and quite rich, understated
        //- liked how it focused on the audience too, so many background characters..like in these sports events everyone joins
        //- together for an isolated Moment. it's pretty modern, almost like scientific in the way the film is "studying" this event
        //- and the romantic aspect was pure, uncomplicated, not central to the plot but central to the character,
        //-  more about caring about someone truly than about falling in love

        span.sub 1948, Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger
      //- amazing!! captivating, could not take my eyes away .. it's like
      //- the film medium itself was an expressionistic ballet, or perhaps the ballet
      //- was  a film?? idk ... the red shoes also a haunting/chilling metaphor for
      //- the ballet production itself..obsession, cold-heartedness of lermontov,
      //- the music is the only thing that matters
      //- ballet x surrealism x film
      //- the ballet itself was a surreal expressionist masterpiece of film
      //- Lermontov IS the red shoes!!!!!
      //- 23 Sep
      //- like one of the best dance films ever, and probably on my list of all-time favs
      //- art worth dying for

      li I Know Where I'm Going!
        span.sub 1945, Powell & Pressburger
        //- playful, i like the camera layers, scene transitions, cheerful expressionism(?) of
        //- the film style
        //- also i appreciate the on location / naturally lit filming in sctoland,
        //- the foggy dark daytime sea 
        //- one of the most scottish things ive ever seen..
        //- 28 sep
        //- i enjoyed this, though the plot was kind of wandering, here and there, it had a very british :: scottish qualitiy, and scattered with nuggets of expressionist film style in a wonderfully moody, naturally lit scotland shot on location
      li The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp
        span.sub 1943, the archers
        //- a fun movie
        //- love the abrupt alternations between serious War and Politics stuff and
        //- mundanities (want to go the movies? will you stay for dinner?). the editing and writing
        //-  esp in this are a delight
        //- ilike roger livesey, he's a blast
        //- this is real  interesting comedy and storytelling, and compared to other 
        //-  films creating around this time (esp. american) this is much less trite
        //- and due to the talent of the writers, actors, and editors, really comes together
        //- as enjoyable and innovative cinema!
        //- I look forward to watching the rest of powell  & pressburgers films :)
