    p.title Mildred Pierce
    p.sub 1945
    img(data-src='#{path}/mildred_pierce.png')
    p.date 1 May 2020
    p.description This story has so many layers of complexity that I'm too lazy to parse out, but most of the complexity derives wholely from the Mildred/Veda dynamic, and could be outlined as: the toxic mother-daughter relationship between Mildred and Veda; the impossible push/pull between needing to be upscale mother (i.e. not working, being high-society, being wealthy) and working hard to sustain such a lifestyle; the tragedy that the parent's sacrifice pushes the child away (ultimately to win the child, the parent must give up everything they've worked to create); possibilities of analyzing Mildred as the "father" of the house--missing life while working and trying to buy children's love--and this, perhaps, as the root (according to the film) of Mildred's struggles: attempting to be both mother and father; and, the obvious parasitic nature of money and "lifestyle". The last lines spoke by Mildred, "Darling, I'm sorry. I did the best I could" cap off the film so well. Mildred somehow still loves her rotten daughter--which is sadly (or heroically) how it goes with parents. Also, this is my first Joan Crawford experience!

    p.date 29 April 2020
    p.description This film was genuinely hilarious with A++++ smiles and some truly beloved crazy cats and amazing nigh-psychadelic dance montages that I wished would never end<br><br>also the first time Jean Hagen (who plays Lina Lamont) speaks has got to be the funniest moment in cinematic history

    p.title Rope
    p.sub Alfred Hitchcock, 1948
    img(data-src='#{path}/rope.png')
    p.date 27 April 2020
    p.description second Hitchcock film in a week in which a doe-eyed Farley Granger has gotten somehow involved with a murder-happy psychopath. I appreciated the weird camera "transitions" (I put this in quotes because these didn't always change scenes) in this one in which we zoom into someone's back. I also noticed how the film was like an Aristotelian play: unity of time, place, and action. The plot is clearly someone's sadistic nightmare of a dinner party...

    p.title Strangers on a Train
    p.sub Alfred Hitchcock, 1951
    img(data-src='#{path}/strangers_on_a_train.png')
    p.date 24 April 2020
    p.description loved the tennis match as an element of suspense. Camera mvmts during this scene were great, and got increasingly erratic which really drove the movie toward its climax at the crazy carousel scene: a mirroring of the first scene of the film with the fast moving train, but like a twisted psychotic version, with the spinning.
    //- p.description rly thrilling
    //- patricia highsmith novel! and Farley Granger is a true beau
    //- tennis match as an element of suspense...nice. Camera mvmts during this scene were great, got increasingly erratic
    //- crazy carousel as climax confrontation scene was great aand clever ttouch as well. Invoked the beginning scene with fast moving train, but like a twisted psychotic version, with the spinning.

      Reactions:
      <br>
      - I can't believe this was in made in color??
      <br>
      - Clark Gable is not handsome at all, and all of his character's love scenes made me uncomfortable, they were so aggressive and almost all non-consensual. Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes though was alright--overall, a darling.
      <br>
      - I appreciate the outright selfishness of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), and how slight her character growth was LOL
      <br>
      - Melly Hamilton (Olivia de Havlland) was definitely the best
      <br>
      - This is the 1940's interpretation of the 1860's, what does this even mean for me watching in 2020? It's impossible to say.
      <br> 
      - Icky racial politics in this one, but has come some ways from <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>
      <br>
      - Too long, clearly, but still entertaining. I was engaged the whole time, and by the time it was over it felt definitely deserving of the term "epic"

    p.title Cléo from 5 to 7
    p.sub Agnès Varda, 1962
    img(data-src='#{path}/cleo1.png')
    p.date 12 April 2020
    p.description I love the walking, car, and bus scenes in this film. They take their time. As the audience we get to see how the figures in and around Cléo's life seem increasingly to turn on her, what it's like to be a woman, to be a celebrity, to beautiful, to be looked at, to be ignored; we also get Cléo's voice and we get to walk with her--see her day darken and brighten and so forth; meet some old friends, some new ones. It's a special experience. Loved Michel Legrand's cameo character.

    p.date 10 April 2020
    p.description Ingrid Bergman! It's refreshing to see an old film with a main woman character who's not flat, shrilly, and melodramatic; Bergman was nuanced, multi-faceted, elusive, intense. I was impressed by this film...I liked that the romantic element of the plot was focused on a love affair that was entirely in the past--and so it looked backward, involved lingering emotions, and the aftermath of something that already happened. Humphrey Bogart's character was unpredictable, and Paul Henreid was charming as Victor Laszlo. Bergman is the real show-stealer though...I see the magic in her; will watch more of her films.

    img(data-src='#{path}/my_life_as_a_zucchini.png')
    p.date 8 April 2020
    p.description Wow, this was so nuanced..filled with the innocent darkness and sadness of children who've gone through trauma, and ultimately about love and the meaning of home, family. The animation was really cute and strange.<br><br>Also, this is the second French movie I've seen that has used <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agk1byIie70'>Sophie Hunger's "Le vent nous portera"</a> as end credits...it's so good! (The other movie was <i>Cafe de Flore</i> (2011).) Sophie Hunger also wrote the rest of the music for this movie -- which did an excellent job creating rich emotional tones.

    p.description Ohhhhhhhh my goshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is a must watch, this movie was so deserving of every reward. It speaks of life like <i>Shoplifters</i> but with of course added twisted layers like <i>The Handmaiden</i> and some class-based thrill/horror like <i>Get Out</i>. Plus it's absolutely hilarious!

    p.title Lost Highway
    p.sub David Lynch, 1997
    img(data-src='#{path}/lost_highway.png') 
    p.date 8 February 2020
    p.description I watched this so that I could read David Foster Wallace's essay on Lynch, "David Lynch Keeps His Head," where DFW does a good job analyzing just why exactly Lynch makes you feel the way you do after watching any of his movies, which is, to be preciese: irrationally frightened out of your mind. <i>Lost Highway</i> was no exception to the Lynch directorial phenomenon for me. It was fascinating and alluring, but I don't think I can take another Lynch movie for a few months.
